As a Game Designer at Qorpo Games Studio, I played a pivotal role in shaping "Citizen Conflict." My responsibilities included designing game mechanics, enhancing UI/UX, and contributing to the creation of PVP maps. I also worked on essential elements such as hero abilities, weapon design, and player movement.
