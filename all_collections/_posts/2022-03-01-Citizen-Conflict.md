Citizen Conflit is a team-based hero shooter with fast-paced gameplay, played from the third person view. Players are able to choose from 4 classes and plenty of heroes. Each hero is equipped with unique abilities.

As a game designer at Qorpo Games Studio, I played a key role in creating "Citizen Conflict." I shaped and designed the game mechanics, contributed to UI/UX efforts, and participated in designing PVP maps for the game.
