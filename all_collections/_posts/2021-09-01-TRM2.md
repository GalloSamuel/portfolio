Trade Race Manager 2, a free-to-play blockchain racing game, offers players the opportunity to own NFT cars and racers. Engage in races and tournaments, where you can earn IOI tokens by competing against fellow players. The performance of your car is closely tied to the crypto currencies (fuel) you select to power it, mirroring the performance of these currencies in the market. This way users learn how the real market works.

My role was integral in crafting the unique and engaging world of Trade Race Manager 2.
